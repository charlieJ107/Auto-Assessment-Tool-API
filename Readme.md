# Auto Assessment Tool API Backend
by cardiff.ac.uk - CMT313-22/23 Group 5

This project is a backend for the Auto Assessment Tool API. It is a RESTful API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete assessments and questions. It also allows users to create, read, update, and delete users and user roles. The API is built using the Go and [Gin-Gonic](https://gin-gonic.com) Framework.

This Readme file is completely generated by GitHub Copilot. It is not perfect, but it is a good starting point for a Readme file.
